    <div class="article__content">
      <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
      <p>In today's digital world, it can be difficult to imagine what life would be like without technology. As we continue to move forward, the field is continuing to advance at a rapid rate. One new form of technology that has been getting attention in recent years is called the Internet of Things. While the term IoT is becoming more common, what exactly is the Internet of Things?</p>

      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of any devices, including digital machines, like washing or drying machines, wearable technology, or smart televisions, that have the ability to connect to the internet. IoT allows the devices to store and interpret data that can be used in the future. Its technology allows these different devices to communicate and share data among one another without any form of human intervention. Although it is still a relatively new concept, the advances in technology allows nearly any object to be transformed into an IoT device.</p>

      <h2>What are its uses?</h2>
      <p>While many understand what the definition of IoT is, they may not have a strong grasp of how prominent the form of technology is becoming in the today's households. While IoT has become much more common, an early example of an IoT advice is wearable technology, which include Fitbits and Apple Watches. Wearable technology generally collects data on a person's movement throughout the day, including the amount of steps, strenuous activity, and sleep patterns of the person. That data is kept and stored in the device, and can be shared with other devices, including the person's cell phone or laptop. People can use the data that the device saved to use in the future. Additionally, the person has the capability to connect it with other devices, keeping it all together.</p>

      <h2>What does the future of IoT look like?</h2>
      <p>How do experts describe the future of the Internet of Things? While IoT has already made a substantial jump in recent years, it is only expected to make a significant impact in the future. One concept that has received considerable attention points at the evolution of smart homes. Smart homes allow a person to connect with electronics in their home, and can be accessed at anytime, even if the person is not home. This allows people to complete smaller tasks by communicating through technology, making household chores more efficient.</p>

      <p>For example, a person could control their thermostat, unlock doors to let someone inside, or even turn on their dishwasher through their own smart device. This can not only allow for quicker, more efficient solutions to everyday problems, but it will also be able to help people complete tasks at a quicker rate.</p>

      <p>The future of the Internet of Things is exciting for many reasons. Not only can it help us become more connected around the world, but it can create a more efficient environment. Check back to later blogs to learn more about different IoT devices and advances in its technology!</p>
